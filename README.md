# EHR - Phase 2 Project

## Learning Goals

- Build a React single page application from scratch
- Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
- Incorporate client-side routing
- Use data from an API

## Introduction
Hi! My name is Hanson Hua. Thanks for viewing my project for Phase 2! I feel like I've spent a lot of time on it, more than I should've, but React has been so enjoyable coding, and building I had gotten lost in my sense of time and completion. Using everything I have learned up to this point of the program, I have built this Single Page Application for Phase 2 using React.

A little about this program: Optometry EHR (Electronic Health Records) is a modern web-based application built to assist optometrists and eye care professionals in managing patient information, appointments, and more. This application provides a user-friendly interface and efficient tools for optometry practices.

## Features
- **Patient Management:**
  - Add new patients with detailed information.
  - Update patient records with the latest data.
  - Delete patient records when needed.

- **Appointment Scheduling:**
  - Easily schedule eye examinations and appointments.
  - View, update, and manage appointments efficiently.
  - Remove appointments from the calendar as required.

## Technologies Used

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- **React:** The user interface of this EHR system is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive web applications.

- **Material-UI:** Material-UI is used to provide a clean and modern design for the user interface components and elements.

- **FullCalendar:** FullCalendar is integrated for managing and displaying appointments and schedules in an organized calendar view.

- **React-Router-DOM:** React-Router-DOM is used for handling routing and navigation within the application.

- **Axios:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to interact with your server or external APIs.
